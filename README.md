# Backend-Api-con-Python

> Basic but complete backend with FastApi and Mongo DB
>>FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints
>>Fast: Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go
>>Fewer bugs: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors.
>>Standards-based: Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: OpenAPI (previously known as Swagger) and JSON Schema.

>I wanted to try FastApi for a while so I decided to create the project while I was learning FastApi
